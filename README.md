# Tornadoes-in-the-United-States-website
A site that shows the project process in the data science

In this project we wanted to test whether we can predict the intensity of the next tornado in the United States according to a number of different parameters (year, length, width, number of wounded, number of deaths, property damage).
                        We found a number of very interesting things about the causes of tornado strength.
                        There are explanations of each step and on the last page it is possible to ask questions about the project.
